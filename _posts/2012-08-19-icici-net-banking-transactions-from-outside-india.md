title: 'ICICI net banking transactions from outside India'
---

One of the concerns I had when I moved to the United States was if I will be able to make net banking transactions from here. I had this concern since I was aware of the fact that ICICI sends you a One Time Password (OTP) on the cell phone number registered with them, every time you make a transaction from a new computer, and I was not using the registered cell phone number here in the U.S.

Turns out all you need to do is, call this ICICI U.S toll free number - 1-866-424-2448, key in your debit card number and the PIN when prompted by the automated voice assist, talk to a customer care executive and ask him for the OTP. I was on the webpage that asked for my OTP while I was doing this. Once, the OTP is successful, your computer in the new location must be recorded in the ICICI servers and it won't ask you for an OTP for future transactions.
