title: 'Billmonk woes and a rudimentary solution'
---

Over the past few weeks, I along with my roommates have been using <a title="Billmonk" href="https://www.billmonk.com/" target="_blank">Billmonk</a> to track our expenses. Unfortunately, the sites uptime has been very bad lately. Heck, it won't even allow adding new expenses anymore (as of 27-Aug-2012). I was very skeptical if the site will totally be abandoned in the near future. Hence, i decided to look around if there is a way to export the data we have been storing in it and voila! there is a way to <a title="export" href="https://www.billmonk.com/export" target="_blank">export</a> it. You can export your data in XML among other formats. Now, I had the data in hand but no easy way to summarize the expenses. So, I thought I would parse it and summarize the data. Feel free to go through the <a href="https://github.com/warunsl/Billmonk-Parser/blob/master/BillmonkParser.rb">code</a>, use it and <a title="let me know" href="https://twitter.com/warunsl" target="_blank">let me know</a> if there are any mistakes.
