title: 'The Last Lecture'
author: 'Randy Pausch, Jeffrey Zaslow'
quotes:
- 
- If you can find your footing between two cultures, sometimes you can have the best of both worlds.
- If you want something bad enough, never give up (and take a boost when offered).
- Sometimes all you have to do is ask, and it can lead to all your dreams coming true.
- One rule in our house is that you may not ask one-word questions.
- It can be a very disruptive thing for parents to have specific dreams for their kids. As I see it, a parent's job is to encourage kids to develop a joy for life and a greate urge to follow their own dreams. The best we can do is to help them develop a personal set of tools for the task.
- Having seen so many students go through my classrooms, I've come to know that a lot of parents don't realize the power of their words. Depending on a child's age and sense of self, an offhand comment from Mom or Dad can feel like a shove from a bulldozer.

My dad's dear friend gifted me this book a decade ago. A few tries and an audiobook later I finally finished this book this weekend. Thoroughly enjoyed the sheer number of life advice gems disguised as a dying man's preparation for his "last lecture". Here are some quotes I loved from the [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00139VU7E)
